# ðŸŽ²Doomed Dice Challenge

## Overview

The Doomed Dice Challenge is a Java-based console application that simulates rolling two six-sided dice (Die A and Die B) and calculates the distribution and probabilities of the sums obtained. Additionally, the application provides a way to transform the dice when they are "doomed" by certain constraints imposed by the Norse God Loki.

## Problem Statement

### Part-A

1. **Total Combinations**: Calculate the total number of combinations when rolling two six-sided dice.
2. **Distribution of Combinations**: Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together.
3. **Probability of Sums**: Calculate the probability of all possible sums occurring among the number of combinations from the previous step.

### Part-B

Loki dooms the dice with the following conditions:
- Die A cannot have more than 4 spots on a face.
- Die A may have multiple faces with the same number of spots.
- Die B can have as many spots on a face as necessary, even more than 6.

The probability of obtaining the sums must remain the same as before.
